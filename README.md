Welcome Spring Semester 2024 students to our course **Artificial Intelligence**, taught by **Prof. Dr. Damian Borth**.

Lectures, exercise sheets and hands-on lab courses alternate to provide a better learning experience in this course. The materials for Artificial Intelligence labs are available and accessible through this repository.

The the lab content is based on [Python](https://www.python.org), [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org). This repository is supported by the course TAs [Joëlle Hanna](https://www.alexandria.unisg.ch/entities/person/Joelle_Hanna/indicators) and [Hamed Hemati](https://www.alexandria.unisg.ch/entities/person/Hamed_Hemati/indicators).



Happy Coding!

## Running the Course Code Lab Notebooks using Google Colab Environment ([![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/GitiHubi/courseAAA/blob/main))

You just have to click the Colab badge next to the Notebooks below. All you need is a Google login
(e.g., your login information for gmail) and you can use this service at no charge.
Two advantages of Colab are that (1) you can save your
Notebooks directly into your Google Drive and read data from there, and (2) Google provides you with some limited GPU capabilities
free of charge (this will be an interesting feature for the coding challenge.)

If you need help running Python and/or Jupyter Notebooks, please don't hesitate to contact us (see below)!
